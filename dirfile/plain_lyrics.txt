The Weeknd - Hurry Up Tomorrow (Lyrics)

Whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa)
Whoa (whoa), whoa, whoa, whoa
Wash me with your fire
Who else has to pay for my sins?
My love's fabricated, it's too late to save it
Now I'm ready for the end
So burn me with your light
I have no more fights left to win
Tie me up to face it, I can't run away, and
I'll accept that it's the end
And I hope that I find what I'm looking for
I hope someone's watching from up above
Done with the lies, done with the loss
Hope my confession is enough
So I see Heaven after life
I want Heaven, when I die
I want to change, I want the pain
No more, yeah
I took so much more than their lies
They took a piece of me, and I've been trying
To fill that void that my father left
So no one else abandons me
I'm sorry (yeah)
I promise I'm sorry, yeah
Now I'm drowning in the same tub where I learned how to swim
With my mother trying to save every ounce of my innocence
I failed her like I failed myself
I'm sorry (yeah)
Mama, I'm sorry, oh, yeah
And I hope that I find what I'm looking for
I hope that he's watching from up above
Done with the lies, done with the loss
Hope this confession is enough
So I see Heaven after life
I want Heaven, when I die
I want to change, I want the pain
No more, oh, yeah
No, I need Heaven after life
I want Heaven, when I die
I want to change, I want the pain
No more, no more, no more, ah, ah
