"BILLIONAIRE"

Baby, I'ma monster

I've never felt like this before
They stop when I walk through the door
Something click, it's a state of mind
Type of rich, can't be quantified
And it ain't my fault if you not trying to match my mood
Sorry but that's on you (You, you, you)

Baby, I don't mean to brag
You know I'm not talking cash
Got a thing that's only mine
And I watch your eyes go green
I can feel your jealousy
Up here in the sky, sky

Oh (Oh), look at me (Look at me), I woke up (I woke up)
Feeling like a billionaire, woah
World is mine, yeah, life is so unfair
Money don't compare, I got something rare
Feeling like a billionaire

I got rules here to break
Say it with my chest and in your face
Hear the boom in the bass
Pump it up, back it up, turn in up, R-U-K-A
ACE-sa be the name, so cut the deck, deal it out
Above the money power and respect
, who that? Who that? Who that?
Got the flame, bet it on me, double up your life

Baby, I don't mean to brag
You know I'm not talking cash
Got a thing that's only mine
And I watch your eyes go green
I can feel your jealousy
Up here in the sky, sky

Oh (Oh), look at me (Look at me), I woke up (I woke up)
Feeling like a billionaire, woah
World is mine, yeah, life is so unfair
Money don't compare, I got something rare
Feeling like a billionaire

Billionaire, b-b-b-b-billionaire
BABYMONSTER got me feeling like a billionaire
Billionaire, b-b-b-b-billionaire
BABYMONSTER got me feeling like a billionaire (Oh, oh, oh)

Oh (Oh), look at me (Look at me), I woke up (I woke up)
Feeling like a billionaire, woah
World is mine, yeah, life is so unfair
Money don't compare, I got something rare
Feeling like a billionaire
